# Welcome to Code

Code is a repository of code challenges. 
Test yourself and improve your code skill by solving problems in five levels: easy, medium, hard, expert and real world!

For this project Python 3 is required. But you can translate the problems  to any language.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Choose the folder according to the desired level.
3. Test the project.
4. Erase the solution and try to solve the problem for yourself.
5. Extra challenge: erase either the solution and test and after that, try to use TDD to solve it. 

 ```console
git clone https://github.com/valeriofarias/code.git
cd code
cd easy/fizzbuzz
python -m unittest
```
